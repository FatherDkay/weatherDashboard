# weatherDashboard
Week 6 Weekly Project
Without question, this was the most challenging project to date. 

Functional:  
* Search by City, State
* New button generated based on input
* HTML dynamically genereated to display current weather (including nifty weather icon) and 5 day forecast
* Searched cities are locally stored and on load buttons are generated based on saved cities
* Overall format is close (close is a relative term) to provided model
* Some error handling was successful
  
 Not So Much:
* 5 Day forecast icons are not displaying (console log inspections shows they are there with correct urls.  No idea what the deal is)
* Redundent buttons are possible (tried to create a system to determine if the serarched city was already stored.  Had to give up becuase mental healh was being compromised)
* Would like to have improved error handling and snazzed up the interface a tad.  Wanted to format City, States automaticaly as titleCase but mixed results there and again the whole mental health this was a factor.
 
 My brain hurts
